# CyberCoin-Static-FrontEnd

Cyber Coin is a Virtual Currency created to use in the Cybersecurity club at Cypress Bay High School. It is integrated with club achievements, attendance, and surveys. This repository only shows the static version of the front end development of the currency using a leaderboard. However, the main web application was build with PHP and a MySQL server hosted on 000webhost.com
